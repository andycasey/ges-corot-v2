# Anything matching the propagate_flags_by_spectrum (when used as a PostgreSQL 
# `LIKE` query, e.g.: "TECH LIKE '%{spectrum_related_flag}-%'") will be 
# propagated to other results that use (any part of) the same spectrum. For 
# example, specifying '10100' will search for TECH entries matching '%10100-%' 
# (the dash - is included for you)
#propagate_flags_by_spectrum:
#  no_constraint:
#    - 10100 # Saturated spectrum


# Anything matching these flags will cause us to mark that particular node 
# result as being suspicious, and won't get used in homogenisation.

# NOTE: If you have time, you should actually look to see what effect this has
#       on the individual nodes, because some will be able to handle these
#       conditions while others will not, so you may be throwing away data!
